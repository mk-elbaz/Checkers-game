# Checkers-game

## General:
My first app or game! It was my second semester project and it was so exciting to work on in quarantine.

## The Game:
It's a 2-player game, red vs blue. 
Pawns move diagonally forward only.
King pawns move diagonally in all directions.
If you have to defeat your opponents pawn you can't make any other move.
Pawn gets upgraded to king if you reach the last row on your opponent's side.
You win if you defeat all his pawns or if your opponent can't move.

# Enjoy!
